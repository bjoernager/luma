		<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
		<p>TO-DO: Write short introduction to the programming language and the reasons it was made.</p>
		<h2>CODING PRINCIPLES</h2>
		<p>Luma has the following coding principles:</p>
		<p>TO-DO: Write down the principles.</p>
		<h2>IMPORTANT FORMATING INFORMATION ABOUT LITERALS</h2>
		<p>Luma is morden in the sense it breaks free of traditions which, more often than not, are from the beginning of the age of the computer.</p>
		<p>To begin with, integral literals are written in base-twelve.</p>
		<p>The number 10 would be written as ↊ (U+218A ↊ Turned Digit Two), and the number 11 would be written as ↋ (U+218B ↋ Turned Digit Three).</p>
		<p>They are also written as little-endian, so numbers increment to the right instead of the left.</p>
		<p>Down below is a short conversion table for how integral literals must be written:</p>
		<p>TO-DO: Create conversion table.</p>
		   8 -> 8
		   9 -> 9
		  10 -> ↊
		  11 -> ↋
		  12 -> 01
		  13 -> 11
		  14 -> 21
		  15 -> 31
		  16 -> 41
		 100 -> 48
		 120 -> 0↊
		 132 -> 0↋
		 144 -> 001
		 156 -> 011
		 168 -> 021
		1000 -> 4↋6
		1728 -> 0001
		<p>And lastly integral literals must have the '#' (U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN) prefix.</p>
