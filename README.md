# Luma

luma is an emulator for the AGB&mdash;Game Boy Advance platform.

# Usage

```
luma [configuration]
```

Invoke the emulator via the `luma` command.

## Configuration

The emulator tries to read the configuration file at `${HOME}/.luma.toml`. If successful, the following fields are read (all must be present):

`luma`:
 * `version`:    The configuration format (currently 0)

`device`:
 * `bootloader`: The path to the bootloader file
 * `image`:      The path to the image file

`video`:
 * `scale`:      The scale modifier applied to the screen (1-4294967295)

If a path is parsed as a terminal parameter, the configuration at that location is read instead.

# Compatibility

Currently, the emulator has limited support for the Arm instruction set. All of the instructions used in the provided test program are &ndash; however &ndash; implemented.

The entire memory space (`0x00000000` to `0x0E00FFFF`) is available, however, no I/O-mapped addresses are currently functional.

Improved support is, of course, planned.
