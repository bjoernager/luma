IMPORTANT FORMATING INFORMATION ABOUT LITERALS:

Integral literals in Luma are written in base-twelve.
The number 10 would be written as ↊ (U+218A ↊ Turned Digit Two), and the number 11 would be written as ↋ (U+218B ↋ Turned Digit Three).
Also, integral literals are also written as little-endian, so numbers increment to the right instead of the left.
Down below is a short conversion table for how integral literals must be written:
   8 -> 8
   9 -> 9
  10 -> ↊
  11 -> ↋
  12 -> 01
  13 -> 11
  14 -> 21
  15 -> 31
  16 -> 41
 100 -> 48
 120 -> 0↊
 132 -> 0↋
 144 -> 001
 156 -> 011
 168 -> 021
1000 -> 4↋6
1728 -> 0001
Also remember that integral literals must start with '#' (U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN).
